<h1>Programming</h1>
<P>First and foremost, the most important thing to realize about the LambdaMOO 
system is that there really isn't anything like a program to deal with.
In C++, every program has a main function.  For LambdaMOO, any implicit main
program is safely concealed inside the internals of the system, and programmers
have no say in the matter unless they wish to start hacking away at server code.
For LambdaMOO, a programmer is restricted to constructing objects and their verbs.
Like any object oriented system, a programmer could argue that the execution paths
through the various verbs constitues a program, but unfortunately that argument tends
to break down quickly since the entire point of having functions on an object is so that
other objects can interact with each other.  That's the point of object oriented
programming.</P>
<P>Unless otherwise noted, when specifying commands for performing some action,
any text enclosed in square brackets is optional.  E.g. <i>FunctionName(Arg1 [,Arg2)</I>
indicates that Arg2 is optional when calling the function Arg1.</P>
<P>Having said that, the next issue is how one constructs objects to do meaningful
things in LambdaMOO.  The major issues at this point are

<a name="data_types">Data Types in LambdaMOO</A>
<UL>The data types for LambdaMOO are
    <LI>
        <b>Integers</b>  Signed whole numbers.  
    </LI>
    <LI>
        <b>Object</b>  Objects in the LambdaMOO database are referred to
        by their object number.  #ObjectNumber denotes an object number
        (for example #0 is object number 0).  The object number is
        essentially a pointer to an object, since there is no such
        notion as passing an object by value for the LambdaMOO system.
        toobj(...) will convert either strings like "#42" or 42 to objects,
        and both result in #42.
    </LI>
    <LI>
        <b>Strings</b>  Characters in LambdaMOO are strings of length 1.
        Like lists, LambdaMOO strings are immutable.
    </LI>
    <LI>
	<b>Error</b>  Various run time errors, such as security violations,
        type mismatches, unassigned variables, etc.  Consult the
        programmer's manual for more information.
    </LI>
    <LI>
        <b>Lists</B>  In LambdaMOO, lists are a the fundamental
        data type for constructing things like arrays and sets.
        The elements in a list can be assigned to destructively,
        but in order to change the length of a list it is necessary to
        do something like <P>
	    MyList={@MyList,NewElement}</P>
        <P>Elements of a list can be of any type allowed for variables in
        LambdaMOO, including lists themselves.</P>
        See the section on <a href="#lists">Lists for more details.</a>
    </LI>
    <LI>
        <b>Floating point numbers</b>  Signed real numbers.
        It is important to note that in LambdaMOO,
        33 <em>is not equal</em> to 33.0.

<a name="create_object">Creating Objects</A>
<UL>The three major ways of creating objects in LambdaMOO are 
	<LI>
	    <P>@create ParentObject named "Object Names"
            </P>
	    <P>This first method is used by human beings to create objects,
               and is something which would be entered on the command line.
               For example: </P>
	    <b>@create $thing named "my very own object"</b>
	    <P>will create an object derived from $thing (Generic Thing)
               and set the new object's name to <i>my very own thing</i>
            </P>
        </LI>
	<LI>
	    <P>create(ParentObject [,OwnerObject])</P>
	    <P>This method is intended for programmatically creating new
               objects by invoking the interpreter's built in <b>create</b>
               function.  Both ParentObject and OwnerObject are required to
               by <a href="syntax.html#object_reference">object references</a>.
               If OwnerObject is not specified, then the object will own itself
               (see <a href="security.html#object_ownership">object ownership
               in the security section</A>).  The return type of create will
               be the object reference of the newly created object, or else
               the appropriate error code.</P>
             <P>For example: <P>
	     <b>create($npc,player)</b>
             <P>will create an object derived from $npc and owned by the
                player object which caused this verb to be executed.</P>
        </LI>
	<LI>
            <P>$recycler:_create(Parent, [,OwnerObject)</P>
	    <P>This method is also intended for programmatically creating new objects
               but in this case it differs from the built in function in a subtle
               manner.  When create() is used, the object reference will always be
               unique.  $recycler:_create attempts to objects discarded with
               $recycler:_recycle(NoLongerNeededObject) by reconstructing a previously
               used object into its new role.  In a perfect world this verb is
               indistinguishable from the create function, except that its friendlier to
               longer lived systems which create many temporary objects.
            <P>
        </LI>
</UL>
<a name="create_properties">Creating properties on an object</A>
<UL>The major ways to add properties to an object in LambdaMOO are
	<LI>
            <P>@property ObjectName.PropertyName [PropertyValue]</P>
            <P>This first method is intended for use by human beings when constructing
               objects before they are put into use.  If PropertyValue is omitted,
               the property is initialized to 0.</P>
	</LI>
        <LI>
	    <P>add_property(TargetObject,PropertyName,InitialValue,Info)</P>
            <P>This method invokes the built in add_property function to add
               the property PropertyName to the object TargetObject.  For more
               information, please consult the online help using
               <b>@help add_property</b>
            </P>
        <LI>
            <P>Use tkMOOlite or MacMOOSE</P>
            <P>Andrew Wilson's tkMOOlite or the MacMOOSE programs each have
               nice interactive object browser's which allow a programmer to 
               interactively add properties and verbs to an object.
            </P>
        </LI>
</UL>
Needless to say, it is generally horribly complicated to add properties
to objects from within a verb, and for most purposes there isn't really
any need to.  I'd personally recommend staying true to the rule of thumb that
say "If you think you need to add a property to an object from within a verb
you're probably wrong."  To change the value (or type for that matter)
of a property, the easiest way is simply to assign it a new value.  
Programmatically, this is simply
<PRE>
    ObjectReferece.Property = NewValue;
</PRE>
and to change a value at the command line, the only difference is to add
a semicolon (to tell the command line interpreter that you are typing in
an expression and not a command), like so:
<PRE>
;ObjectReference.Property = NewValue;
</PRE>

<a name="lists">Fun with lists and strings</a>
<h5>Accessing and modifying elements of lists and strings</h5>
<P>To access a particular element of a list or string, the square braces
are used.  Elements are numbered sequentially from 1 to n, where n is the
length of the string or list.</P>
<P>Assigning to an element of a list or string modifies the corresponding
element of the list or string. </P>
<P>For example:</P>
<PRE>
    Test="George";	// Our example string
    Test[3]="4";	// Test is now "Ge4rge"
    Test[5..6]="56";    // Test is now "Ge456e"
    Test={"A","B","C"}; // Our example list
    Test[2]="BC";	// Test is now {"A","BC","C"};
    Test[2]="BC","DE";  // Error.  Invalid statement.
    Test[2]={"BC","DE"}; // Test is now {"A",{"BC","DE"},"C"};
</PRE>
As shown in the example, the elements selected from a list or string can
be more than one element long.  However, those elements have to be
continuous.  For example
<PRE>
    "George"[3..3]	// "o"
    "George"[3..5]	// "org"
    "George"[3..5,7..9] // syntax error
</PRE>
Strings can be costructed using the + operator to append two strings together.
Unfortunately, this modifies neither of the two original strings.
<PRE>
    OriginalName="George";
    LastName=" The Great";
    NewName=OriginalName+LastName;
</PRE>
Changes neither OriginalName or LastName.  There is absolutely nothing
wrong with assigning like
<PRE>
    OriginalName="George";
    LastName=" The Great";
    OriginalName=OriginalName+LastName; // OriginalName = "George The Great"
    OriginalName="George"+LastName;     // Same result
    OriginalName="George"+" The Great"; // Same result
</PRE>
In fact, this way of appending to strings in absolutely necessary.
In LambdaMOO (as in Java), a string is only as long as it absolutely
has to be, and to append to a string (such as changing a string stored
in a property) requires such a construct.
<P>Lists are constructed in a similar manner.  The ampersand operator,
when applied to the front of a list name, expands out to the contents
of that list.  For example:
<PRE>
    List={1,2,3,4,5};
    List={@List};			// Identity operation
    List={@List,6};			// List = {1,2,3,4,5,6};
    Counter=1;
    while(Counter<6)
        List={@List,Counter};
        Counter=Counter+1;
    endwhile
    // List is now {1,2,3,4,5,6,1,2,3,4,5}
    NewList=List[7..10];		// NewList = {1,2,3}
</PRE>
<P>The elements of a list can be lists themselves.  There is no restriction
on the layout of each sublist, and lists can be nested arbitrarily deep
to construct multidimensional arrays or fancy data structures.</P>
<PRE>
    List={};
    List={@List,{},{},{}};		// List now contains three empty lists.
    List[1]={1,2,{3,4,5,6}};		// The first list in List now contains
					// the list {1,2,{3,4,5,6}}
    List[3]=List[1];			// The third list in List now contains
					// a copy of List[1]
    List[3][3][2]=7;			// List is now
					// { {1,2,{3,4,5,6}}, {}, {1,2,{3,7,5,6}} }
</PRE>
For both lists, the <b>in</b> operator is very useful.  <b>in</b>
is a binary operator, the left argument being the element to look for,
and the right element being the list to search.  Its value is the
position in its target to search, or 0 if the element is not found.
<PRE>
    (5 in {1,2,9,3,5,2}) 	// result is 5
    (4 in {0,4,4}		// result is 2
</PRE>
Like assignment, using in to look for substrings won't work.  Likewise, if
you construct a complicated list structure, in only checks the list
and not any elements in the list.
<PRE>
    ({1,2} in {0,{1,2},{3,4}}) // result is 2
    (2 in {0,{1,2},{3,4}})     // result is 0
</PRE>
<P>Various utility objects, such as $string_utils, $set_utils, 
$assoc_utils, $match_utils, and others are available for use.  
The specific documentation is available by
<b>@examine</b>ing the appropriate objects, or reading the comments
in the verbs of the object.</P>
<P>The really important thing to remember is that if your were all set
to use a binary tree, hash table, or other data structure normally
implemented using pointers, you have two choices:  1--rethink the
algorithm using lists, or 2--write, find or convince someone to write
a set of functions to implement that data structure using LambdaMOO's
lists.
