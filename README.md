# the-new-moo-programming-guide
The New MOO Programming Guide is an updated and expanded version of the LambdaMOO programming Programming Guide, converted to HTML5 and optimized for the web.

## Notes
1. This is a work in progress
2. The stylesheet can be swapped out with a normal bootstrap style sheet.
3. I've tried to format the functions in a more modern way

## TODO
1. Finish full HTML5 conversion
2. Finish applying proper styles to elements
3. Create an index page
4. Link to relevant GitHub Repositories for LambdaMOO DBs
5. Add more advanced programming examples
6. Add a section on benchmarking
7. Add a section on LambdaMOO plugins / extensions

## Contributing
Please feel free to fork the repo and contribute.  This is a labor of love.  I've been using LambdaMOO for almost 13 years and I wanted to give back to the community.  Text based gaming is an important part of our history and our future.  No game is more accessible to those with handicaps, for example.
