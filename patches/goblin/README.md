# Warning

I haven't been able to get this to work. It seems to be looking for MIN_LIST_CONCAT_LIMIT which may be GammaMOO specific. Am unsure.

## From SourceForce

This extension pack holds several new built-ins as a counterpart of their MOO-verb equivalents.

```
$object_utils:ancestors() => ancestors()

$string_utils:space() => space()
$string_utils:char_list() => char_list()
$string_utils:explode() => explode()
$string_utils:words() => words()
$string_utils:from_list() => from_list()
$string_utils:english_list() => english_list()
$string_utils:from_seconds() => from_seconds()

$set_utils:diff*erence() => set_diff()
set_difference()
$set_utils:union() => set_union()
$set_utils:intersection() => Disabled due to a bug

$list_utils:reverse() => list_reverse()
$list_utils:setremove_all() => setremove_all()

```

I found out that the from_list function is broken when you feed it non-strings in args[1].. It causes a server panic.. I will look into this and post an updated version soon, but be advised to disable the builtin meanwhile..
